<p>I'm a 24-year-old woman with a passion for coding. I have a background in molecular biology and genetics, but I'm currently focused on becoming a successful Full-Stack Developer. I'm currently enrolled in a Full-Stack Development Bootcamp at Up School, where I'm fortunate to have received a full scholarship.</p>



## **ðŸ”­ What I'm currently working on**

I'm currently diving deep into various programming languages and frameworks to sharpen my skills in full-stack development. I'm particularly interested in back-end technologies like C#, .Net, Node.js and databases like MongoDB, as well as front-end technologies like React.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, HTML, CSS, and  

## **ðŸŒ± What I'm currently learning**

As part of my Full-Stack Development Bootcamp, I'm learning a wide range of technologies and tools. Some of the key areas I'm focusing on include:

- Building responsive and accessible web applications
- Creating RESTful APIs and integrating them with front-end frameworks
- Developing database schemas and working with data storage solutions
- Version control with Git and collaborating on GitHub projects

## **âš¡ Fun fact**

When I'm not coding, you'll often find me on the ice rink, indulging in my passion for ice skating â›¸â›¸. It's a great way for me to relax and stay active.
